## Overview


### I. Introduction


### II. Neighbourhood crime
 

### III. Victimized groups


### IV. Common types of crimes


### V. Need for DB system

When managing a myriad of data related to crime, numerous problems emerge. For instance, various crimes could unfold in real-time or be discovered at multiple zones. Also, there could be certain hotspots where specific crimes are reoccurring, or people of a particular race are getting targeted, which requires urgent investigation. In addition, victims and criminals must be tracked for further investigation and maintaining records. Therefore, the need for a crime data management system arises to address these problems, which can manage data efficiently and concurrently while keeping data integrity. The crime data management system can be used to manage crime, generate reports, and analyze crime trends in the region so that justice is served appropriately.
